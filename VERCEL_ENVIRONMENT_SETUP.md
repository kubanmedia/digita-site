## How to Set Environment Variables in Vercel

1. **Log in to Vercel Dashboard**: Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with kubanmedia@yahoo.com
2. **Select Your Project**: Choose the digita.click project
3. **Go to Settings**: Click on the "Settings" tab
4. **Environment Variables**: Click on "Environment Variables" in the sidebar
5. **Add Variables**: For each environment variable above:
   - Click "Add New"
   - Enter the **Variable Name** (e.g., `AI_BOT_SYSTEM_PROMPT`)
   - Enter the **Value** (the system prompt content)
   - Select appropriate environments (Production, Preview, Development)
   - Click "Save"

## Environment Options

For each environment variable, you can set different values for:
- **Production**: The live website environment
- **Preview**: Deployment previews and testing
- **Development**: Local development environment

It's recommended to use the same values across all environments for consistency.

## Fallback Behavior

The chatbot system includes fallback behavior:
1. **First Priority**: Environment variables (recommended for production)
2. **Second Priority**: system.txt files (for local development)
3. **Third Priority**: Default built-in prompts (minimal functionality)

## Testing the Setup

After setting the environment variables:
1. Deploy your project to Vercel
2. Test each chatbot by visiting their respective pages
3. Verify that the chatbots respond according to their configured personalities
4. Check Vercel function logs if there are any issues

## Troubleshooting

- **Chatbot not responding correctly**: Check if the environment variable name matches exactly
- **Fallback to default behavior**: Environment variable might not be set or accessible
- **Deployment issues**: Ensure all environment variables are saved and the project is redeployed

## Security Benefits

Using environment variables instead of system.txt files provides:
- **Better Security**: Sensitive prompts are not stored in the codebase
- **Easier Management**: Update prompts without code changes
- **Environment Separation**: Different prompts for different deployment stages
- **Serverless Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Vercel's serverless functions
